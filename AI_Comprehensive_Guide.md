**Applications:**
- Function approximation
- Optimization algorithms
- Understanding local behavior

### 2.3 Probability and Statistics

Probability theory provides the framework for dealing with uncertainty, which is inherent in real-world data.

#### Basic Probability

**Sample Space (S):** Set of all possible outcomes

**Event (E):** Subset of the sample space

**Probability:** P(E) = |E| / |S| (for equally likely outcomes)

**Axioms:**
1. 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1
2. P(S) = 1
3. P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

#### Conditional Probability

**P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)**

**Bayes' Theorem:**
**P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)**

**Applications:**
- Naive Bayes classifiers
- Bayesian inference
- Updating beliefs with evidence

#### Random Variables

**Discrete:** Takes countable values (e.g., number of heads)

**Continuous:** Takes any value in a range (e.g., height)

**Probability Distribution:** Describes likelihood of each outcome

#### Important Distributions

**Normal (Gaussian) Distribution:**
- Bell-shaped curve
- Defined by mean (μ) and variance (σ²)
- Central Limit Theorem

**Binomial Distribution:**
- Number of successes in n trials
- Parameters: n (trials), p (probability)

**Poisson Distribution:**
- Events in fixed interval
- Parameter: λ (rate)

**Uniform Distribution:**
- All outcomes equally likely

#### Statistical Measures

**Mean (Expected Value):** E[X] = Σ xᵢ × P(xᵢ)

**Variance:** Var(X) = E[(X - μ)²]

**Standard Deviation:** σ = √Var(X)

**Covariance:** Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-μₓ)(Y-μᵧ)]

**Correlation:** ρ = Cov(X,Y) / (σₓ × σᵧ)

#### Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Default assumption

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** What we're testing for

**p-value:** Probability of observing data if H₀ is true

**Significance Level (α):** Threshold for rejecting H₀ (typically 0.05)

### 2.4 Optimization Techniques

Optimization is at the heart of machine learning—finding the best parameters to minimize error or maximize performance.

#### Gradient Descent

The fundamental optimization algorithm for machine learning.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize parameters θ randomly
2. Compute gradient ∇J(θ)
3. Update: θ = θ - α × ∇J(θ)
4. Repeat until convergence

**Learning Rate (α):** Controls step size

**Variants:**
- Batch Gradient Descent: Uses all data
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Uses one sample
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Uses small batches

#### Advanced Optimizers

**Momentum:**
- Adds velocity to updates
- Helps escape local minima

**Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):**
- Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates
- Most popular optimizer for deep learning
- Maintains running averages of gradients

**RMSprop:**
- Adapts learning rate per parameter
- Good for recurrent networks

#### Convex Optimization

**Convex Function:** Line between any two points lies above the function

**Properties:**
- Local minimum = Global minimum
- Efficient algorithms exist
- Many ML problems are convex

**Methods:**
- Gradient Descent
- Newton's Method
- Conjugate Gradient

#### Constrained Optimization

**Lagrange Multipliers:** Handle equality constraints

**KKT Conditions:** Handle inequality constraints

**Applications:**
- Support Vector Machines
- Portfolio optimization
- Resource allocation

### 2.5 Information Theory Basics

Information theory provides tools for quantifying information, crucial for many ML algorithms.

#### Entropy

Measures uncertainty or randomness in a distribution.

**H(X) = -Σ P(x) × log₂(P(x))**

**Properties:**
- Higher entropy = More uncertainty
- Maximum for uniform distribution
- Zero for deterministic outcome

**Applications:**
- Decision tree splitting
- Feature selection
- Model evaluation

#### Cross-Entropy

Measures difference between two distributions.

**H(P, Q) = -Σ P(x) × log(Q(x))**

**Applications:**
- Loss function for classification
- Model training objective
- Comparing predictions to true labels

#### Kullback-Leibler Divergence

Measures how one distribution differs from another.

**KL(P || Q) = Σ P(x) × log(P(x)/Q(x))**

**Properties:**
- Non-negative
- Zero if P = Q
- Not symmetric (not a true distance)

**Applications:**
- Variational Autoencoders
- Model comparison
- Information bottleneck

#### Mutual Information

Measures dependency between variables.

**I(X; Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)**

**Applications:**
- Feature selection
- Understanding relationships
- Information bottleneck method

## SAMPLE CODE EXAMPLES

### Python Implementation of Linear Regression

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0][0]:.4f}")
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_[0]:.4f}")
print(f"MSE: {mse:.4f}")
print(f"R² Score: {r2:.4f}")

### Neural Network with TensorFlow

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784) / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784) / 255.0

# Build model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
